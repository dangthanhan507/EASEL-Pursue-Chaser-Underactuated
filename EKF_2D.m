classdef EKF_2D
    %{
        This is the discrete HCW EKF
        Prediction is based on discrete matrices Ax+Bu
        Measurement is based on using jacobian with nonlinear functions.
        x_t+1 = Ax_t + Bu_t
        c_t = h(x_t)
        Example Using EKF:
        ------------------
            Call state_estimator = ChaserEKF
            Q = eye(6)
            R = eye(3)
            state0 = zeros(6,1);
            cov0 = zeros(6,6);
            u = ....;
            tstep = 1;
            state_estimator.initEKF(state0, cov0);
            state_estimator.prediction(u, Q, tstep)
            state_estimator.sensor_correct(z_t, measCov, phase)

                Parameters:
                ------------
                    state0: 6x1 vector that defines state of spacecraft.
                    cov0: 6x6 matrix that defines current covariance
                Description:
                ------------
                    Simply initializing object for state estimation.

            %{
                Parameters:
                ------------
                    u: 3x1 vector control input of thrusters (in accel)
                    systemCov: 6x6 matrix system covariance of EKF.
                    tstep: discrete timestep of EKF.
                    
                Description:
                ------------
                    Implementation of the prediction of spacecraft state
                    given the previous state. This is a rough estimate that
                    uses linear dynamics of the system. Namely, the
                    Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations for relative space
                    motion. This assumes discrete control input over time.

                Parameters:
                -----------
                    z_t: 3x1 or 2x1 measurement vector of EKF.
                    measCov: 3x3 or 2x2 covariance matrix of meas.
                    phase: the phase that spacecraft is in
                Description:
                ------------
                    NOTE: requires prediction to have been run beforehand.
                    Runs the sensor_correct that corrects prediction to a
                    much more accurate state by conditioning on the
                    observed measurement variable in the HMM formulation of
                    EKF.
